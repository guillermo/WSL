# Get started mounting a Linux disk in WSL 2 (preview)

If you want to access a Linux disk format that isn't supported by Windows, you can use WSL 2 to mount your disk and access its content.

This tutorial will cover the steps to identify the disk and partition to attach to WSL2, how to mount them, and how to access them.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to be on Windows 10 Build 20211 or higher to access this feature. You can join the [Windows Insiders Program](https://insider.windows.com/) to get the latest preview builds.
> Administrator access is required to attach a disk to WSL 2.
> WSL 2 `mount` command does not support mounting disk (or partitions belong to a disk) that is currently in use (You can't mount a partition from the same disk as Windows).

## Identify the disk

To list the available disks in Windows, run:

```powershell
wmic diskdrive list brief
```

The disks paths are available under the 'DeviceID' columns. Usually under the `\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE*` format.

## List and select the partitions to mount in WSL 2

Once the disk is identified, run:

```powershell
wsl --mount <DiskPath> --bare
```

This will make the disk available in WSL 2.

Once attached, the partition can be listed by running the following command inside WSL 2:

```powershell
lsblk
```

This will display the available block devices and their partitions.

Inside Linux, a block device is identified as  `/dev/<Device><Partition>`. For example, /dev/sdb3, is the partition number 3 of disk `sdb`.

Example output:

```powershell
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sdb      8:16   0    1G  0 disk
├─sdb2   8:18   0   50M  0 part
├─sdb3   8:19   0  873M  0 part
└─sdb1   8:17   0  100M  0 part
sdc      8:32   0  256G  0 disk /
sda      8:0    0  256G  0 disk
```

## Identifying the filesystem type

If you don't know the type of filesystem of a disk or partition, you can use this command:

```powershell
blkid <BlockDevice>
```

This will output the detected filesystem type (under the `TYPE="<Filesystem>"` format).

## Mount the selected partitions

Once you have identified the partitions you want to mount, run this command on each partition: 

```powershell
wsl --mount <DiskPath> --partition <PartitionNumber> --type <Filesystem>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to mount the entire disk as a single volume (i.e. if the disk isn't partitioned), `--partition` can be omitted.
> 
> If omitted, the default filesystem type is "ext4".

## Access the disk content

Once mounted, the disk can be accessed under the path pointed to by the config value: `automount.root`. The default value is `/mnt/wsl`.

From Windows, the disk can be accessed from File Explorer by navigating to: `\\wsl$\\<Distro>\\<Mountpoint>` (pick any Linux distribution).

## Unmount the disk

If you want to unmount and detach the disk from WSL 2, run:

```powershell
wsl --unmount <DiskPath>
```

## Command line reference

### Mounting a specific filesystem

By default, WSL 2 will attempt to mount the device as ext4. To specify another filesystem, run:

```powershell
wsl --mount <DiskPath> -t <FileSystem>
```

For example, to mount a disk as fat, run:

```
wsl --mount <Diskpath> -t vfat
```

> [!NOTE]
> To list the available filesystems in WSL2, run: `cat /proc/filesystems`

### Mounting a specific partition

By default, WSL 2 attempts to mount the entire disk. To mount a specific partition, run:

```
wsl --mount <Diskpath> -p <PartitionIndex>
```

This only works if the disk is either MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPT (GUID Partition Table). [Read about partition styles - MBR and GPT](/windows-server/storage/disk-management/initialize-new-disks#about-partition-styles---gpt-and-mbr).

### Specifying mount options

To specify mount options, run:

```powershell
wsl --mount <DiskPath> -o <MountOptions>
```

Example:

```powershell
wsl --mount <DiskPath> -o "data=ordered"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Only filesystem specific options are supported at this time. Generic options such as `ro, rw, noatime, ...` are not supported.

### Attaching the disk without mounting it

If the disk scheme isn't supported by any of the above options, you can attach the disk to WSL 2 without mounting it by running:

```powershell
wsl --mount <DiskPath> --bare
```

This will make the block device available inside WSL 2 so it can be mounted manually from there. Use `lsblk` to list the available block devices inside WSL 2.

### Detaching a disk

To detach a disk from WSL 2, run:

```powershell
wsl --unmount [DiskPath]
```

If `Diskpath` is omitted, all attached disks are unmounted and detached.

> [!NOTE]
> If one disk fails to unmount, WSL 2 can be forced to exit by running `wsl --shutdown`, which will detach the disk.

## Mount a VHD in WSL

You can also mount virtual hard disk files (VHD) into WSL using `wsl --mount`. To do this, you first need to mount the VHD into Windows using the [`Mount-VHD`](/powershell/module/hyper-v/mount-vhd) command in Windows. Be sure to run this command in a window with administrator privileges. Below is an example where we use this command, and also output the disk path. Be sure to replace `<pathToVHD>` with your actual VHD path. 

```powershell
Write-Output "\\.\PhysicalDrive$((Mount-VHD -Path <pathToVHD> -PassThru | Get-Disk).Number)"
```

You can use the output above to obtain the disk path for this VHD and mount that into WSL following the instructions in the previous section.

You can also use this technique to mount and interact with the virtual hard disks of other WSL distros, as each WSL 2 distro is stored via a virtual hard disk file called: `ext4.vhdx`. By default the VHDs for WSL 2 distros are stored in this path: `C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Packages\[distro]\LocalState\[distroPackageName]`, please exercise caution accessing these system files, this is a power user workflow.

## Limitations

- At this time, only entire disks can be attached to WSL 2, meaning that it's not possible to attach only a partition. Concretely, this means that it's not possible to use `wsl --mount` to read a partition on the boot device, because that device can't be detached from Windows.

- USB flash drives are not supported at this time and will fail to attach to WSL 2. USB disks are supported though.

- Only filesystems that are natively supported in the kernel can be mounted by `wsl --mount`. This means that it's not possible to use installed filesystem drivers (such as ntfs-3g for example) by calling `wsl --mount`.
